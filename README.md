# Selectivity_FourNeuronsModel

### NumericalSimulation.py 
- runs the parallel simulations for chapter 3.2 (A Four Neuron Model for Direction Selectivity) and 4 (On Learning Selective Weights through Plasticity) 
- outputs activity, weights and threshold evolution plots (Figure 4.2 and 4.4)

### Figure_3.1_PhaseDiagrams.py
- Figure 3.1: Plots conditions of selectivity states for model 1, 2, 3 in case of steady simuli

### Figure_3.3_MovingStimuli.py
- given data from NumericalStimulation.py with moving stimuli
- Figure 3.3 a: Plots evolution of activity 
- Figure 3.3 b: Plots bar plot of output selectivity for model 1,2,3 and test 1,2

### Figure_4.3a_FitWeights.py
- given data from NumericalStimulation.py with plasticity
- Figure 4.3 a: Fit of weight data

### Figure_4.3bcd_BarPlotsWeights.py
- given data from NumericalStimulation.py with plasticity
- Figure 4.3 b,c,d: Bar plot of fitte parameter values $T$, $m_{start}$, $m_{end}$ for model 1,2,3 and test 1,2,3,4

### ParameterSearchConnectivity.py
- runs grid search to find similar initial conditions across models
- explained in chapter 3.2 (A Four Neuron Model for Direction Selectivity) page 21, last paragraph
- used for chapter 3.2 (A Four Neuron Model for Direction Selectivity) and 4 (On Learning Selective Weights through Plasticity) 

### Folder Implementation
- contains functions of numerical simulation and network model
